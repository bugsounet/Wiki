> MMM-GoogleAssistant no longer has built-in plugins
{.is-warning}

That's why there are plugins to add and just the ones you want to use !

> With MMM-GoogleAssistant, you have a lot of choice !
{.is-success}


> The generation of Extended plugins is able to communicate with each other to form a single module
{.is-success}

In order to communicate with GAv4 plugins needs a Gateway

Gateway is able to:

* Lock your screen when a plugins is playing and prohibit going into sleep mode
* Prohibit to use 2 plugins in sametime (can't listen Spotify and watch YouTube at the same time for exemple)
* Turn off all not needed plugins and keep the last plugin demand
* Unlock your screen and return in normal mode when no plugins are used
* Read MMM-GoogleAssistant response and launch automaticaly a plugins (photo, browser, youtube...)
* Control MMM-GoogleAssistant with Google Home app (smartphone) or another google assistant device (google nest)

All name of MMM-GoogleAssistant plugins start with EXT and the Gateway will apply many rules for make deal between MMM-GoogleAssistant and plugins

Gateway have a database of ALL EXT plugins for apply self rules.

MMM-GoogleAssistant 💭 -> Gateway 🎼 <-> EXT plugins 🎹

Gateway is a real conductor 🙂

> Without Gateway, MMM-GoogleAssistant can't works !
> You MUST install it !
